During my role as a Connected and Automated Vehicle Research Engineer at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/), I developed a fully automated system meant to follow a pre-defined speed trace with minimal tracking error. This included a full system architecture design, development of a clean user interface, state machine, control system, and real-time performance.

I tested this system at the following proving grounds:
- [General Motors Milford Proving Grounds](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xDVB3nK9e3b8Ng1c6) in Miford, MI (April 2025)
- [General Motors Desert Proving Grounds](https://maps.app.goo.gl/maHuxLtCw5wTwafr6) in Yuma, AZ (May 2025)
