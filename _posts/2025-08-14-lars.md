## The Challenge

Developing and testing new automated vehicle controllers is often difficult due to inconsistencies in vehicle platforms and test environments. A major hurdle is the inability to perform repeatable lead vehicle testing, which is essential for benchmarking controller performance across different vehicle types and test tracks. A modular, vehicle-agnostic solution was needed to enable standardized and consistent testing.

## The Technical Solution

As a Connected and Automated Vehicle Research Engineer at Argonne National Lab, I architected and developed the **Longitudinal Automated Replay System (LARS)**. This modular system enabled repeatable lead vehicle behavior by following a predefined speed trace with minimal tracking error. My work included:

* **System Architecture:** Designed a vehicle-agnostic system using a standardized bus architecture and the FlexIL vehicle interface, allowing any ACC controller to be integrated via a plug-and-play approach.
* **Deployment:** Successfully designed and deployed the system on multiple platforms, including a 2024 Cadillac Lyriq and a 2023 Toyota Prius Prime, using comma.ai override systems.
* **UI/UX:** Developed a clean user interface and a robust state machine to manage the system's control and real-time performance.

## Impact & Results

The LARS system revolutionized how we conducted automated controller testing, ensuring consistency and reliability across various test scenarios and vehicle platforms.

* **Validated Performance:** LARS was successfully validated during DOE AVATAR-funded testing at General Motors' Milford Proving Grounds and Desert Proving Grounds.
* **Enabled Benchmarking:** The system enabled cross-platform controller benchmarking, a critical step in evaluating the performance of new automated driving systems.
* **Cross-Program Integration:** The framework's success has paved the way for its adoption in other projects at the lab.
