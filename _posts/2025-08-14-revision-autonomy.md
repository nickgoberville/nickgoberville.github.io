## The Challenge

As an innovator in the autonomous vehicle space, I recognized a significant gap between our research and a viable commercial product. The technical solution—tire track detection for autonomous driving in snow—was scientifically proven, but the path to a successful business was undefined. The challenge was to move beyond the laboratory and apply a rigorous, customer-centric approach to determine if there was a market need and a sustainable business model for our technology.

## The Solution

To bridge this gap, I co-founded **Revision Autonomy** and applied the principles of the **Lean Startup Methodology**, a framework for developing businesses and products based on validated learning. This process was a core component of my participation in the [National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps/about-i-corps) program. My work included:

* **Extensive Customer Discovery:** I led a team of three to conduct over **150 customer discovery interviews** with potential stakeholders, including automotive OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and government agencies. The goal was to test our core business hypotheses and gain a deep understanding of customer pain points.
* **Business Model Canvas:** I developed and iterated on a Business Model Canvas, mapping out key partners, activities, value propositions, customer segments, and revenue streams based on the feedback from our customer discovery efforts.
* **Value-Driven Development:** The insights gathered from our interviews directly informed our technical roadmap, ensuring that development efforts were focused on features that provided the most value to our potential customers.

## Impact & Results

This venture, while ultimately not commercialized, was a profound learning experience that demonstrated my ability to navigate the complexities of product development and market validation.

* **Secured Funding:** My team successfully won over **$215,000 in program and research development funding**, a testament to the strength of our technology and the potential of our commercialization strategy.
* **Validated Learning:** We proved that our technology was technically feasible and that a hierarchical perception system could significantly improve autonomous navigation in adverse weather. However, our market research revealed that the industry's timeline for adopting such a solution was still in its early stages.
* **Holistic Perspective:** This experience fundamentally shaped my approach to engineering, teaching me to prioritize user needs and business impact alongside technical excellence. I now approach every project with a "product-minded" perspective, ensuring that the work is not only robust but also meaningful and valuable to its end-users.
