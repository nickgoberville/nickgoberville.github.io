## The Challenge

The EcoCAR EV Challenge is a prestigious, multi-year collegiate automotive engineering competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and General Motors. The competition tasked 13 North American university teams with designing and building a next-generation battery electric vehicle. My role was to serve as the Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) Organizer, a critical position that required me to manage a large-scale, multi-stakeholder program. The primary challenges included setting a cohesive technical scope, providing consistent guidance to a diverse group of students, and developing a standardized testing framework to ensure fair and accurate evaluation of each team's work.

## The Solution

As the CAV Organizer for the EcoCAR EV Challenge, I was responsible for leading the technical direction and execution of the CAV portion of the program. My work included:

* **Strategic Vision:** I led the scope and vision for all CAV activities for the $6 million program, ensuring alignment with the U.S. Department of Energy's mission of transportation efficiency. This involved defining the technical requirements for features like Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (C-ACC), Lane Centering Control (LCC), and Automatic Intersection Navigation.
* **Mentorship and Guidance:** I served as the primary mentor for over **200 graduate and undergraduate students** across 13 university teams. My guidance was essential in helping them design, develop, and integrate their CAV features into the competition vehicle, a 2023 Cadillac LYRIQ.
* **Test and Evaluation Frameworks:** I architected and implemented key testing solutions to ensure repeatability and fairness. This included designing the VIL dynamometer testing workflow and the LARS replay system to evaluate the energy consumption and performance of the teams' automated controllers.

## Impact & Results

This role had a far-reaching impact, not only on the competition but also on the next generation of engineers and the broader research community.

* **Workforce Development:** I directly contributed to building a pipeline of highly skilled engineers by providing students with hands-on, industry-relevant experience in complex systems integration and testing.
* **Standardized Testing:** The VIL and LARS testing frameworks I developed became the standard for evaluating CAV performance in the competition, ensuring fair, repeatable, and high-fidelity results.
* **Industry and Academic Collaboration:** My role required close collaboration with key stakeholders from industry, academia, and government, including General Motors, MathWorks, dSPACE, and other partners. This collective effort drove innovation and advanced the state of the art in CAV testing methodologies.
