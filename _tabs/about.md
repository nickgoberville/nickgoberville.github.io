As a research engineer, I thrive at the intersection of software, simulation, and physical systems. My passion lies in architecting solutions that bridge the digital and physical worlds—from developing control interfaces for automated vehicles to creating tools that make complex systems easier to test and deploy. I believe in building things that are not only technologically advanced but also reliable, understandable, and genuinely useful.

In my current role at **Argonne National Laboratory**, I lead the scope and vision for connected and automated vehicle (CAV) activities within the **$6 million U.S. DOE EcoCAR EV Challenge**. This involves guiding over 200 students from 13 universities in developing and integrating autonomous driving features into a 2023 Cadillac LYRIQ. I've designed standardized communication interfaces for Vehicle-in-the-Loop (VIL) testing and architected modular, vehicle-agnostic replay systems like LARS to ensure repeatable and high-fidelity evaluation of automated controllers.

Before my time at Argonne, I co-founded **Revision Autonomy**, where we secured over $215,000 in funding to commercialize a camera-based perception system for navigating snow-covered roads—a direct outcome of my Ph.D. research.

My work is driven by a desire to tackle challenges that require both big-picture systems thinking and meticulous low-level technical detail. Whether it's through leading national research programs, publishing cutting-edge work, or launching a startup, my goal remains the same: to engineer a more efficient and reliable automated future.
