I am a systems architect and software developer who loves building things that solve complex, real-world problems. My approach is simple: start with the big picture, find the most efficient path forward, and build solutions that are both practical and scalable. My work is driven by a genuine curiosity about how systems—whether they're software applications, physical hardware, or teams of people—can be designed to work together seamlessly.

This mindset was honed through my Ph.D. work in automated systems at Western Michigan University and my experience co-founding a startup. I've learned that true innovation comes from a clear focus on the end goal and a willingness to explore different methods to get there.

Outside of my work, I'm always seeking a new challenge, whether it's completing a half-Ironman or taking on a new passion project. I believe in continuous growth, respecting diverse perspectives, and ensuring a team moves forward as a cohesive unit. I am excited to apply my skills to new challenges and add value to an industry where a systems-level approach can make a meaningful difference.
